function [ avg ] = ballVelocity( fileroot, filenames )
%This function calculates the average x velocity of a tracked object in a 
%CinePlexvideo file. The last variable is assumed to be the ball
%Inputs: fileroot (string) excluding file name
%        filenames (cell array of strings) file names separated by commas


%Generate a set of names for each file's data values
fSetup(1:length(filenames)) = {'file'};
fNames = genvarname(fSetup);

for c = 1:length(filenames)
    
%Construct file name
filepath = cell2mat(strcat(fileroot,'/',filenames(c),'.txt'));

%Load the data from the file into a variable
dataMat = load(filepath);

%Fill a data structure with the data from the file
data.(fNames{c}) = dataMat;

%Calculates the number of variables (columns) and data points (rows)
[Length, numVars] = size(dataMat);

%Give names to the time variable and the last set of x-values in the
%data file. Assumes the ball is the last thing tracked and only finds
%x velocity
time = data.(fNames{c})(:,2);
x = data.(fNames{c})(:,numVars - 1);

%Plot position vs time
plot(time, x)

%Get user input on the range of values to consider for average velocity
[tS, bpS] = ginput(2);
bpS;
tS;

%Calibration to change from pixels to mm approximately, this would
%need to be adjusted for every run unless you calibrate the CinePlex
bpS = bpS .* 40/134

avgV(c) = (bpS(2) - bpS(1))/(tS(2) - tS(1))
